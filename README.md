# RailroadGame

This is implementation of my simple economic simulation game inspired by [Railroad Tycoon 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon_3) on PyGame. By now it's in development. 

You will need this to run it:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7 or higher
* [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame)
